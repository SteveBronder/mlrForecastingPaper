Time series models have not only become more common, but more complex. The \\proglang{R} language ~\\cite{Rbase} has a large task view with many packages available for forecasting and time series methods. However, without a standard framework, many packages have their own sub-culture of style, syntax, and output. The \\pkg{mlr} ~\\cite{mlr} package, short for Machine Learning in R, works to give a strong syntatic framework for the modeling pipeline. By automating many of the standard tools in machine learning such as preprocessing and cross validation, \\pkg{mlr} reduces error in the modeling process that is derived from the user. \n\nWhile there are some time series methods available in the \\pkg{caret} ~\\cite{caret}, development of full on forecasting models in \\pkg{caret} is difficult due to computational constraints and design choices. The highly modular structure of \\pkg{mlr} makes it the best choice for implementing time series methods and models. This paper will show how using \\pkg{mlr}'s strong syntatic structure allows for time series packages such as \\pkg{forecast} ~\\cite{HyndForecast} and \\pkg{rugarch} ~\\cite{rugarch} to use machine learning methedologies such as automated parameter tuning, data preprocessing, model blending, cross validation, performance evaluation, and parallel processing techniques for decreasing model build time.\n\n\\section{Forecasting Example with the M4 Competition}\n\nThe Makridakis Competitions ~\\cite{Makridakis2000451} are organized by International Institute of Forecasters and are used to evaluate the accuracy of different forecasting methods.\n\n<<get_m4, cache = TRUE>>=\nlibrary(M4comp)\nlibrary(xts)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nm4_fin1 <- M4[[28]]\nm4_fin2 <- M4[[29]]\nm4_fin1_index <- as.POSIXct(\"1971-04-10\") + days(0:I(length(m4_fin1$past)-1))\nm4_past1 <- xts::xts(m4_fin1$past,m4_fin1_index) \n                     \n                     Start = c(1971, 4) \nEnd = c(1996, 14) \n@\n%% Note: If there is markup in \\(sub)section, then it has to be escape as above.\n\\clearpage\n\\bibliographystyle{plainnat}\n\\bibliography{thesisbib}\n\n\\end{document}\n",
