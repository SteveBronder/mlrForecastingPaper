The methods used in the M-competition and the M3-competition, and many of the measures recommended by previous authors on this topic, are found to be inadequate, and many of them are degenerate in commonly occurring situations. Instead, we propose that the mean absolute scaled error become the standard measure for comparing forecast accuracy across multiple time series.},

This note supports their claim by showing that the MASE fits nicely within the standard statistical procedures initiated by Diebold and Mariano (1995) for testing equal forecast accuracies. Various other criteria do not fit, as they do not imply the relevant moment properties, and this is illustrated in some simulation experiments.},

It is suggested that, instead, σ2 be estimated from a series of regressions of y(t) on y(t - 1), y(t - 2),...,y(t - p), ε̂(t - 1),...,ε̂(t - q), where the ε̂(t) are obtained by fitting a long autoregression to the data. It is shown how the sequence of regressions may, for p = q, be economically recursively calculated by embedding them in a sequence of bivariate autoregressions. Asymptotic properties of the procedure are established under very general conditions.},

abstract="The classification problem is considered in which an outputvariable y assumes discrete values with respectiveprobabilities that depend upon the simultaneous values of a set of input variablesx = {\{}x{\_}1,....,x{\_}n{\}}. At issue is how error in the estimates of theseprobabilities affects classification error when the estimates are used ina classification rule. These effects are seen to be somewhat counterintuitive in both their strength and nature. In particular the bias andvariance components of the estimation error combine to influenceclassification in a very different way than with squared error on theprobabilities themselves. Certain types of (very high) bias can becanceled by low variance to produce accurate classification. This candramatically mitigate the effect of the bias associated with some simpleestimators like ``naive'' Bayes, and the bias induced by thecurse-of-dimensionality on nearest-neighbor procedures. This helps explainwhy such simple methods are often competitive with and sometimes superiorto more sophisticated ones for classification, and why``bagging/aggregating'' classifiers can often improveaccuracy. These results also suggest simple modifications to theseprocedures that can (sometimes dramatically) further improve theirclassification performance.",

    abstract = { An innovations state space modeling framework is introduced for forecasting complex seasonal time series such as those with multiple seasonal periods, high-frequency seasonality, non-integer seasonality, and dual-calendar effects. The new framework incorporates Box–Cox transformations, Fourier representations with time varying coefficients, and ARMA error correction. Likelihood evaluation and analytical expressions for point forecasts and interval predictions under the assumption of Gaussian errors are derived, leading to a simple, comprehensive approach to forecasting complex seasonal time series. A key feature of the framework is that it relies on a new method that greatly reduces the computational burden in the maximum likelihood estimation. The modeling framework is useful for a broad range of applications, its versatility being illustrated in three empirical studies. In addition, the proposed trigonometric formulation is presented as a means of decomposing complex seasonal time series, and it is shown that this decomposition leads to the identification and extraction of seasonal components which are otherwise not apparent in the time series plot itself. }
